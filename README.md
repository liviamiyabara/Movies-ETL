Module 8: ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

## Summary
Amazing Prime video is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows, the team from that company would like to create an algorithm to predict which low budget movies released would become popular so they can buy the streaming rights at a low cost. They will sponsor a hackathon to connect with other coders and provide clean movie data in order to build that predictive algorithm to define popular movies.

In this challenge, the student helps Britta, from Amazing Prime, to create the data sources for the hackathon from two different sources, Wikipedia and Movie lens. In order to do so, we need to extract the data, transform into one cleaned data set and then load it to SQL table. The code has been automated with functions to take new data , perform the appropriate changes and load it to the SQL tables on a daily basis.
